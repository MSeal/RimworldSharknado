> We can't just wait here for sharks to rain down on us.

## Changes:
- Fixes tornados
- Adds sharks

## Description:

Replaces Tornados with Sharknados. They're a bit bitey. Really there's not much else to say.

Though, you should checkout the Mod Settings under Options to configure your Sharknado experience to your liking. Careful with "Sharknado is Life" -- it makes a single Sharknado lag up any PC... Also you'll probably die.

Use debug mode's Execute Incident to SimCity up your base if you get bored. See how many sharknados it takes before the sharks win (crashing the game counts as a win).

I take no responsibility for lost bases or favorite hats.

## Required Mods:
- Hugs Lib

## FAQ:

#### Is this save game compatible?

> It can be added safely. Removal may cause issues with left-over sharks remains.
    
#### Does this conflict with other mods?

> Other tornado mods will likely not work at all (though really, why would you need that with Sharknado). Otherwise no.

#### (Spoiler) How in the name of all that is holy can Landsharks walk?

> Carefully. Aim for the tails... or the jaws... Or get a bigger boat.

#### How much alcohol went into making this?

#### How does this fix tornados?

> With Sharks. Duh.
